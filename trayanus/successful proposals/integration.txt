Hi

As a very experienced Python developer with over 8 years of experiences in this domain, Django is my most experienced skill.

In terms of django, I mastered django 1.x/2.x with python2, 3, REST API development with DRF, Testing code development, Django admin page customization, deployment with Apache/Nginx and Gunicorn/uWSGI.
And I am very familiar with TDD, Celery with RabbitMQ/Redis and PyCharm, virtualenv, etc

So far, I participated in many enterprise SaaS projects by remote, while I was in charge of backend developer.

I am eager to work on this job
Thank you for reviewing and I am looking forward to opportunity to work with you.






Explain how you would build a web application with a modern frontend.

Usually, develop backend and frontend individually and communicate each other by REST API.
Or maybe, we can use webpack and babel to build JS framework files.


We are using Django and Python 2.7, do you think we should upgrade to Python 3?

If you are using django 1.x, we don't need to upgrade to Python3 and if you are going to upgrade django version to 2, we have to upgrade python version from 2.7 to 3.
And in the case of using some packages that support only python3, we should upgrade.
It's completely up to you.







What framework do you prefer using together with Python and Javascript, Why?

I am very familiar with Django and React.js and that's because they are very compatible
React.js is the best JS framework for SPA currently and I guess, react is better than angluar
And so far, I developed many REST APIs using DRF.






Tell me about a previous project of yours that excites you the most. 

https://www.device42.com/
This Project is the biggest one I've ever developed so far
In this project, I was in charge of admin site development and REST API development.
Also, I've upgraded version from 1.6 to 1.11
This CRM uses Micro Service Architecture and PostgreSQL for db


.


Tell me about how you go about debugging a Django app, Maybe you have a story about a bug you hunted down?


I develop most of python projects in PyCharm IDE and it provides strong debugging service.
And also, I am versed in PDB and using Log file to diagnose the errors is one of the good ways to debug.

trading bot
========================================

Hello 

I have also developed the Python cryptocurrency trading and lending bots with Bittrex,Bitfinex and Binance API. 

For your job, we first need to determine how many periods we’re to predict based on SMA/EMA.
I can use linear regression to SMA/EMA predictions.
Multiple EMAs is also possible.
I have decided to use bitfinex.

There is an limit on api calls per minute. Now it is about 90 calls per minute. If it is exceeded then the ip is blocked 10-60 seconds. That's why api integration regarding getting tickers is somewhat difficult.

I have attached the log file and screenshots of my previous project.

I believe that I can provide you with end-to-end service for this project. 
I am a full-time freelancer and I can start working immediately. 

Please feel free to contact me anytime. 

Thank you for taking the time to review my proposal.

=============Jong Hyok===============
As for react native app development, there are two major issues.
One is router.
react-native router flux has issue when working with redux. 
react-native-router-redux is not matured yet.
So I often choose to develop my own router based on react router and react native navigator.

And the other one is to how to properly support both IOS and Android.
-problem with IOS only components. 
In case your current codebase used IOS only components, like tabbarIOS, navigatorIOS, imagepickerIOS. 
So we need to either build android only component or refactor some of IOS code.

-Style based on platform.OS
In this case, components are shared. we need to put different style based on platform.OS value

I have one more thing to mention.
When connecting with APIs in redux, following are the main approach that I use. 
For simple backend APIs, I usually use redux-fetch.
For complicated systems, I make api service classes in ES6 with superagent or request module. And use them in redux actions with fsa-thunk-middlware.

Look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yes, As you can see in my profile

6) What part project or job have you had that is most like this one and why?
개괄보기방식에서는 링크가 눌리지 않기때문에 이 질문은 구체보기방식에서 대방의 관심을 끄는데 중점을 두고 써야 한다. 링크들을 주는데서 매우 중요한것은 대방의 과제에 들어맞는 링크를 주는것이며 그러한 링크들은 앞에 주는것이다. 적중한 링크들만 여러개 주는것도 좋지만 경험적으로 볼때 적중한 링크들은 구분하여 앞에 주고 뒤에 많은 링크들을 더 주는것이 대방의 관심을 끄는데 좋다. 실지 대방들이 여러번에 걸쳐 정말 많은 일을 했다고 하였다. 
실례로 어제 있은 인터뷰에서 한 대방은 "are these all things you did yourself?"라고 감탄하였다.


8) Which of the required job skills do you feel you are strongest at?
I'm using C# ASP.NET, Ruby on Rails, ..., Xamarin.Forms + PCL is what I've been using ...

11) Why do you think you are a good fit for this particular project?

Hi, glad to apply to your offer.

I have built a similar scheduling application with an intuitive UI/UX :
http://teamup.com
http://teamup.com/live-demo

It appears simple but rich functions behind the simple UI is the core of the app's high acceptance rate.
I developed it using ExtJS, composing it as a SPA (Single Page Application).
The calendar view is the main part of the app, a library called Bryntum was used for this.

I am sure this experience is a valuable trait to deliver fast while ensuring quality.
Let's talk more about your project in detail.

Are you willing to provide commitment to complete the work.
 I have saw your work history and I am sure that you are cool client who I am looking.
In my opinion you worked with other freelancer but he(/she) didn't finish your project and ended communication.
So you find a developer who can finish your project.
I think the most important thing for developer is responsibility.
Until now I always worked the best for contract and I will work the best for our contract, too.
It's too difficult to find excellent client for freelancer but also it's not easy to meet responsible freelancer for client.
I will show you high responsibility in our contract. less

Do you have the required skill set and qualifications to complete the project
 Yes. I have enough skill for your project.

Speak about scrapping, I have ever worked for fantasy football site that should to scrape results from nfl.com.

I can do it using php and python but if you want only Ruby on Rails, I will do it using Ruby on Rails.

Below are good point at ROR.
1. Rails is an open source MVC framework.
2.The platform ships with a lot of generators and built in libraries that make getting a working application "scaffolded" and up and running pretty quickly. Hence, saving lot of time and money.

BTC/ Cryptocurrency


1. Using a hardware wallet such as TREZOR.
A hardware wallet has two functions - it stores your Bitcoins in a hardened device that is designed to be simple and highly resistant to the usual range of attacks (viruses, hackers, keyloggers).
2. Create a cold storage wallet using BitKey.
Cold storage wallets generates and stores private wallet keys on a clean air-gapped computer.
Used correctly, an air-gapped wallet is safe from all online threats, such as viruses and hackers. It is however still exposed to offline threats, such as hardware keyloggers, extortion, or people looking over your shoulder.
To spend funds from cold storage securely, an unsigned transaction is generated on an Internet connected computer. An unsigned transaction is akin to to an unsigned check. The unsigned transaction is then transfered to the air-gapped computer to be verified & signed with the wallet keys.
Using a cold storage wallet on an air-gapped computer may seem tedious, but remember that security almost always comes at the cost of convenience.

Are you willing to provide commitment to complete the work.
 I have saw your work history and I am sure that you are cool client who I am looking.
In my opinion you worked with other freelancer but he(/she) didn't finish your project and ended communication.
So you find a developer who can finish your project.
I think the most important thing for developer is responsibility.
Until now I always worked the best for contract and I will work the best for our contract, too.
It's too difficult to find excellent client for freelancer but also it's not easy to meet responsible freelancer for client.
I will show you high responsibility in our contract. less

Do you have the required skill set and qualifications to complete the project
 Yes. I have enough skill for your project.

Speak about scrapping, I have ever worked for fantasy football site that should to scrape results from nfl.com.

I can do it using php and python but if you want only Ruby on Rails, I will do it using Ruby on Rails.

Below are good point at ROR.
1. Rails is an open source MVC framework.
2.The platform ships with a lot of generators and built in libraries that make getting a working application "scaffolded" and up and running pretty quickly. Hence, saving lot of time and money.

BTC/ Cryptocurrency


1. Using a hardware wallet such as TREZOR.
A hardware wallet has two functions - it stores your Bitcoins in a hardened device that is designed to be simple and highly resistant to the usual range of attacks (viruses, hackers, keyloggers).
2. Create a cold storage wallet using BitKey.
Cold storage wallets generates and stores private wallet keys on a clean air-gapped computer.
Used correctly, an air-gapped wallet is safe from all online threats, such as viruses and hackers. It is however still exposed to offline threats, such as hardware keyloggers, extortion, or people looking over your shoulder.
To spend funds from cold storage securely, an unsigned transaction is generated on an Internet connected computer. An unsigned transaction is akin to to an unsigned check. The unsigned transaction is then transfered to the air-gapped computer to be verified & signed with the wallet keys.
Using a cold storage wallet on an air-gapped computer may seem tedious, but remember that security almost always comes at the cost of convenience.
